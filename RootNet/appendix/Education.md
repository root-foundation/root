## RootNet will eat education

Personal tokens will rewrite our entire education system by enabling a better business model: instead of _charging_ for education, great teachers will _invest_ in students they want to train. In an extreme world, this will be the only way teachers will be able to earn what they deserve, and the only way students will be able to incentivize the best teachers to train them.

An education system based on investing instead of charging money will improve the quality of knowledge available for everyone, even for students who aren't yet ready to be invested in. Teachers who charge money to teach are incentivized to hoard their most important knowledge for paying students. On the other hand, teacher-investors are incentivized to distribute all of their knowledge as widely as possible in order to attract more investable talent.
