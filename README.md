RootNet is a network that connects people socially _and_ financially. Users own their data, invest in each other's ideas and potential, and increasingly influence how the network functions and evolves.

RootNet's mission is to unite humanity and unlock our collective potential in the age of intelligence — by giving each person a stake in our collective success, and by democratizing opportunity.

In this essay we explore why we will _need_ RootNet to organize humanity to take advantage of artificial intelligence, our vision of the future, and how we will build it.

## Introduction

Artificial intelligence promises a future of abundance and prosperity in which each individual has unimaginable power to realize their dreams.

But, we're far from _organizing_ ourselves in a way that enables us to take advantage of artificial intelligence to achieve prosperity. On top of our current economic and governance systems, artificial intelligence is poised to concentrate opportunity and divide society.

To see why, we must first understand how artificial intelligence will change our world.

## How AGI will change our world

By Artificial _General_ Intelligence (AGI) we mean an intelligence that can generally _reason_ across any task as well as a human. And that this intelligence also sufficiently _embodied_ such that it is capable of doing most physical tasks that humans do today (e.g. in agriculture, assembly, delivery, etc.). We believe we will achieve AGI sooner than expected, and that such AGI will amplify human potential, _not_ replace the need for humans.

As artificial intelligence advances, our activities will _acceleratingly_ evolve to become more **_complex_** (i.e., more possibilities within them) and more **_alike_** (i.e., being great at one will increasingly translate to being great at all).

**Outcomes in _all_ activities will become increasingly _extreme_**: at any given moment in time, a _smaller_ percentage of individuals will be responsible for a _greater_ share of economic value created — i.e., a _[power law distribution of outcomes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_law)_. The peak outcomes grow exponentially, while the median share falls.

**Rate of displacement of the winners accelerates.** Those who are generating the greatest outcomes will increasingly struggle to retain their dominance. _Churn_ will accelerate.

**The absolute number of winners will grow**. Even though the distribution of outcomes will be far more extreme, since the peak outcomes grow exponentially, even _tiny_ wins (relative to the peak wins) will still be massive. And since the rate of displacement accelerates, in a given period of time, there will be many more who would have touched success.

**Artificial intelligence will enable _many_ more activities than it will render unnecessary**. The range of activities we have witnessed throughout human history will eventually be a drop in the ocean of activities that will eventually exist. While it's impossible to predict the nature of these activities, we _can_ predict that they will be increasingly _similar_: i.e. ability in one will increasingly translates to ability in all, and that they will be highly complex with increasingly extreme outcomes.

**Such change will accelerate.** It is not only technological advancement that causes such change. Any progress (more equal opportunity, better training, etc.) amplifies these changes. Even if AI progress halted for 5 years (unlikely), we would still see accelerating change because we've barely utilized the current technology itself.

---

AGI is a fundamentally different kind of advancement than we've ever seen because it cuts away activities below a certain complexity threshold, _across the board_. Previous advancements (such as computers, smartphones, internet, etc.) did not make less complex work in _all_ domains irrelevant. Even as the reach of software and the internet grew, less complex work continued to exist in various domains (agriculture, supply chain, delivery, etc.).

In other words, previous advancements did not _force_ _everyone_ towards highly complex work. But, AGI does. It is this universal impact of AGI that elevates all human activity towards highly complex work — which have more extreme outcomes.

We call this phenomenon in which our activities acceleratingly evolve to be more complex _and_ alike — towards a _highly complex_, _singular_ activity — [Convergence](Convergence.md).

---

Artificial intelligence will enable us to tackle highly complex problems; from global warming, to health, to food and water scarcity, to space travel, etc. — promising a future of prosperity and abundance that we can't fathom.

But, we are far from being organized in a way to take advantage of artificial intelligence. Even worse, on top of our current systems, artificial intelligence is poised to concentrate opportunity in the hands of those with wealth — significantly delaying, and possibly even preventing, a future in which every one has access to opportunity and abundance, while causing needless suffering.

To see why, let's first understand how our current economic system becomes oppressive in a post AGI world.

## Problem

In an extreme world, debt is no longer a viable means to finance anything.

This is not due to fewer opportunities (AGI will enable far more opportunities than it takes), but rather due to the extreme, winner-take-all nature of outcomes within _each_ opportunity. In extreme outcomes, the median outcome falls to nothing and thus financing with debt is no longer viable.

Tragically, billions are still taking out loans to finance their lives — from their educations, to their homes and businesses — without realizing that they will almost certainly never be able to repay these loans as outcomes rapidly becomes more extreme.

_Even_ if one is debt-free, they will almost certainly be outcompeted by one who can experiment boldly and tinker freely with _abundant_ resources.

And critically, in an extreme world, if people don't have a stake in the collective upside, they will resent the winners — dividing society.

Therefore, we must:

1. Finance human activity in a way that ensures that anyone with potential has access to the resources they need to fully realize their potential — regardless of the circumstances of their birth.
2. Give each individual a stake in the collective upside to elevate our baseline along with our success.

Otherwise opportunity becomes concentrated in those who aren't be burdened by debt (i.e., those with extreme wealth), dividing society and preventing a future of collective opportunity and prosperity.

## Venture capital

In an extreme world, venture capital (VC) is the _only_ viable way to finance our lives.

At its core, venture capital unites people by intertwining their success and failure — through _equity_ in outcomes.

VC is already a popular way to finance startups: investors give startup companies money in exchange for an _equity_ stake in the startup itself. If the startup succeeds, the investors make great returns. If the startup fails, the investors lose their investment. Importantly, startup founders are not indebted to investors. And because of the shared stake, investors are incentivized to give founders the resources they need to succeed.

Venture capital works exceptionally well in domains with extreme outcomes because an investor only needs a few bets to succeed in order to _more-than-compensate_ for the many failed bets they will inevitably have (because the median outcome is failure). Therefore, VC is the only way to finance activities that have extreme outcomes because no other mode of financing can withstand the extreme failure rate.

Since AGI makes _all_ activities extreme, VC will be the only viable way to finance anything. But, VC as, as it exists today, is too restrictive because only those ready to start a company can leverage venture capital. In order to unlock our collective potential, we must enable individuals to access venture capital to finance a broader range of activities, much earlier in their lives.

We need a new _financial instrument_ that democratizes venture capital.

## Personal token

To democratize access to venture capital, we are creating the _personal token_: a financial instrument that represents an individual's potential, with transact-able shares. Individuals can raise venture capital by selling equity in their personal token.

<img src="foundation/assets/personal-token-preview.png" width="500" />

(Jane's personal token with her shareholders and her equities in companies and other personal tokens.)

Your personal token's value is grounded in your equities in companies and other personal tokens. A portion of the capital you gain when selling equity in a company or personal token is sent to your personal token shareholders — proportional to the equity they hold (i.e. dividends).

Unlike company shareholders, personal token shareholders have _no_ “ownership", control or say over the personal token owner or anything they do. **The personal token owner retains absolute, complete agency and control over their lives**.

## The network

Personal tokens can't exist in a vacuum. We need many functions in order to have a thriving ecosystem of individuals investing in each other through their personal tokens (e.g., fighting fraud, enabling discovery, etc.). In order to finance such functions this system will collect a small _equity fee_: a micro stake in every personal token that has successfully raised funds.

To be able to collect this equity fee, we have another _type_ of token called the _network token_. An instance of a network token (i.e., “NetworkToken”) represents the collective potential of the _entire_ network through its micro stakes in all personal tokens. The wallet associated with the NetworkToken is the network's treasury that helps finance all of its functions.

Before we can paint the picture of _how_ personal and network tokens can unite society and democratize opportunity, we need to first see how artificial intelligence is changing our world.

## Personal tokens will democratize opportunity

Personal tokens create a market for human potential that will increasingly allocate resources according to an individual’s potential — _regardless_ of the circumstances of their birth and privilege.

We acknowledge that _initially_ personal tokens will be better harnessed by individuals with privilege. Early individuals who raise capital by selling equity in their personal tokens would have likely had advantages such as better education, access to resources, capital, networks, etc. But eventually, as the network matures through more participants and investments (in number and magnitude), market forces will more aggressively allocate resources to undervalued or undiscovered talent. Thus, market forces will push resources to individuals _earlier_ in their lives across a _broader_ range of activities — preventing wastage of valuable potential and minimizing unfair advantages.

As discussed earlier, _even_ with extreme outcomes we will have a greater absolute number of winners because of rapid displacement of winners (due to accelerating convergence). Furthermore, as artificial intelligence advances humanity, the number of quality contenders will increase (due to better training, resources, leverage, etc.).

Because of more extreme success outcomes _and_ greater number of competent contenders for those outcomes, we will see more widespread investments of greater magnitude. Therefore, even the investment into the median contender will increase.

Thus, personal tokens, and the market forces they create, will increasingly negate privilege — unlocking our collective potential.

## Universal Basic Equity (UBE)

In an extreme world with a falling median outcome, a sufficient baseline of resources for each individual is a prerequisite to democratizing opportunity.

This is best achieved through _Universal Basic Equity (UBE)_: every citizen receives an _equity stake_ in the collective upside — i.e., a stake in the NetworkToken.[^children]

[^children]: UBE also incentivizes having children. When a baby is born, new shares in the NetworkToken is minted for that baby, thus diluting the value everyone else’s shares. Thus, families will be incentivized to have more children to increase their collective equity in the NetworkToken.

In addition to providing a strong baseline, UBE also creates a symbiotic relationship between the individual and the collective. When value is created anywhere, in any form, everyone immediately benefits because the value of everyone’s equity in the collective upside will increase (i.e., value of the NetworkToken rises). UBE incentivizes us to root for each other to win.

Critically, Universal basic _income_ (UBI) will _not_ work on its own because it will cause difficult-to-manage inflation (because capital pumped into the market). Universal basic _equity_ (UBE) will not cause inflation due to the _strong_ incentive to hold your equity in the NetworkToken given the promise of great upside (i.e., belief that humanity will create _even_ more value in the future). 

As long as we have faith in humanity's potential, more people will hold than sell, preventing inflation.

> Note: if needed, in addition to UBE, UBI can also be offered by siphoning some of the dividends the NetworkToken accrues to its shareholders, or by having the NetworkToken periodically sell a percentage of its stakes in every person, triggering dividends for all holders of the NetworkToken. The details of this functionality can be voted on by users.

UBE ensures that every one of descendants will enjoy a level of abundance that we can't fathom. Artificial intelligence and economies of scale will bring the price of all important goods down, while UBE will increase the wealth in each individual's hands without inflation. Furthermore, as your shares in the NetworkToken accumulate, you gain a safety net to take bold risks. Even if you sell all of your equity in the NetworkToken to take a bold risk, UBE share allocations (which will eventually be a continuously flowing allocation) will more than enable you to live a healthy life.

## Money -> Company -> Personal token

The personal token is the next phase in the evolution of financial instruments — as an abstraction that sits above the company, which in turn sits above money.

Simple notions of debt and exchange became painful as the complexity of transactions grew. Over time, this created a pressure which (in a messy, nonlinear way) gave rise to transferrable IOUs — i.e. _money_.

Similarly, debt instruments became a painful means to finance high-risk high-reward expeditions that emerged due to rapid advancement. This created a pressure that gave rise to transferrable equity in upside — i.e. _venture-backed company_.

For instance, in seafaring, bankers simultaneously invested in many risky expeditions in exchange for a stake in the profits, enabling them to profit even when only a few expeditions survived.

Importantly, the notion of a venture-backed company allowed us to assign value to _hope_. The gap between the value of a company and reality (its revenue) is the company’s greatest feature. Being able to _transact_ equity shares of a company enables venture capital financing.

Today, we are at another inflection point. AGI makes _all_ outcomes extreme, not just those in a few domains, invalidating debt as a viable means to finance _anything_. This creates pressure for an instrument that sits _above_ companies: representing an individual’s equities across companies — i.e. _personal token_.

Being able to _transact_ shares of equity in personal tokens enables individuals to access venture capital much more broadly. In the same way that a company enables us to assign value to hope in a particular expression, the personal token enables us to assign value to hope in an _individual_, across all of their expressions.

<img src="foundation/assets/instrument-tree.png" />

## Value will be concentrated in personal tokens

As we advance, value concentrates _upwards_.

Over time, value became concentrated in companies, not transactions. The most valuable companies have been *increasingly* valued more than the sum of their transactions (revenue).

Similarly, in a post AGI world with extreme outcomes, value will become concentrated in personal tokens. A personal token will be valued far more than the sum of the values of its equities in companies _(recall: a personal token’s value is grounded in its equities in companies and other personal tokens)_.

## Tokens will eat the world

Personal tokens will start as a toy in San Francisco, the only place in the world crazy enough to play with it. Most of the world will likely view it as a piece of trash in the sea of "waste" that SF produces. Out of ignorance, some may even perceive it as a tool for exploitation.

Yet, for early adopters, engaging with personal tokens will come naturally as personal tokens formalize and enhance an already prevalent behavior of identifying and mentoring talent early.

Then, personal tokens will rewrite our entire education system by enabling a better business model: instead of _charging_ for education, great teachers will _invest_ in students they want to train. In an extreme world, this will be the _only_ way teachers will be able to earn what they deserve, and the _only_ way students will be able to incentivize the best teachers to train them.

Increasingly, great products and discoveries will find their start in individual explorations financed by personal tokens. Then, investing in personal tokens will become more popular than investing in companies because attention and value become concentrated in individuals holistically, not in their particular expressions.

Future governance structures built upon personal tokens will enable social cohesion through Universal Basic Equity (UBE) that gives everyone a stake in this collective progress.

In an extreme, post AGI world, the outcomes of nations too will be extreme. The most powerful nation will be orders of magnitude more powerful than the next one, leading to economic and cultural domination. This is because the nation that adopts personal tokens first will best maximize their growth by unlocking their collective potential. Eventually, the winning nation will force everyone else into this economic system.

All of society's functions will be grounded in tokens. A rich, _tokenized_ ecosystem of investing in tokens of _all_ kinds — personal tokens, ai tokens, company tokens, country tokens (e.g., "USAToken"), etc. — will emerge to enable venture capital to finance _anything_ that we do.

Tokens will eat the world. And such a tokenized system, through UBE and the marketplace for potential, will help us unite society and democratize opportunity.

Let's explore how to build such a system.

## RootNet

RootNet is a network that connects people socially _and_ financially.

On RootNet, users own their data, invest in each other's ideas and potential, and increasingly influence how the network functions and evolves.

RootNet's mission is to unite humanity and unlock our collective potential.

## Design principles

We believe the best way to create RootNet — given our ignorance about what is best — is one that mimics natural selection, while maximizing the rate of iteration.

We will mimic natural selection through:

1. **Progressive decentralization**. Move power away from centralized authorities.
2. **Fork-ability**. Enable duplication and mutation at any level of abstraction.

## Solution

### Token

RootNet is based on the primitive — _the token_ — that represents an individual or collective.

A token contains the following information:

1. **ID**: a unique identifier.
2. **Ownership**: total number of shares, and mapping between any token.ID to number of shares that token holds.
3. **Wallet**: holds USDC.
4. **Data**: key value mapping that can contain any kind of data: strings, images, videos, and higher representational data formats that we haven't invented yet.
5. **History**: all _interactions_ this token has had with any other token. For example: investing, transacting, liking a post, following, reporting fraud, etc.

There are two _kinds_ of tokens that extend from this base structure: _personal tokens_ and _network tokens_.

- personal tokens are for individuals.
- network tokens are for collectives (companies, nations (e.g., "USAToken"), etc.).

### Ledger

The Ledger is the structure that represents information about _all_ tokens in the network — on a decentralized blockchain. Every edit to the core ledger is recorded and public. Anyone can verify and audit what happens in this system.

### NetworkToken & Treasury

The NetworkToken is an _instance_ of a network token that represents the collective potential of the entire network through its micro stakes in all tokens in the network (which it captures through an equity fee when token shares are transacted). Since the NetworkToken is just another token, it exists _within_ the Ledger.

The NetworkToken's wallet reflects the dividends the NetworkToken accrues through its stakes in all tokens in the network. The NetworkToken is the economic heart of the entire system: fueling all of the activities required to keep this system healthy.

### RootFoundation

This core will be wrapped in a non-profit organization (RootFoundation) that will create, control and develop the Ledger.

RootFoundation’s sole goal is to unite humanity and unlock our collective potential.

In addition to building the core technology, RootFoundation will be responsible for educating the world about these new ideas & helping shape policies in the direction of uniting humanity and unlocking our collective potential.

RootFoundation cannot be “bought”. Owning shares in the NetworkToken does not come with voting rights or influence in governance. Initially, we will be responsible for building the initial RootFoundation team. But over time, we will implement a process to elect & fire RootFoundation members.

RootFoundation members will work together _in person_ at our HQ in San Francisco, California, USA.

### Architecture

<img src="foundation/assets/system-architecture.png" width="600" />

## Applying principles

### 1. Progressive decentralization

The core technology, and all of RootFoundation’s creations, will be built upon decentralized primitives.

Initially, RootFoundation will hold a lot of control. Over time, as the network matures, RootFoundation will progressively decentralize control. For example, early on the RootFoundation will handle reputation and fraud in a centralized way: managing complaints from users, investigating and banning/pursuing legal actions, etc. Over time, as the network matures, RootFoundation will decentralize reputation by incentivizing users themselves to accurately identify misrepresentation/fraud[^decentralized_reputation].

[^decentralized_reputation]: Perhaps something like a transparent, decentralized [community notes](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2023/08/16/communitynotes.html) with appropriate financial incentives.

Such progressive decentralization will enable a rich, competitive ecosystem of ideas, companies, entities, etc. to emerge upon this tokenized foundation. And, users will increasingly have control and influence over all policy and decision making in the network (and how entities engage with the network) through a realtime, fluid _voting system_.

### 2. Fork-ability

This system will be fork-able at its core. If RootFoundation stops serving its users in the way they want, the core ledger itself can be forked, a new NetworkToken issued, and a new foundation can continue the work towards uniting humanity and unlocking our collective potential in a way that's actually aligned with what users want.

All of the RootFoundation’s activity will be publicly available in _this_ repository under an [MIT license](LICENSE), enabling anyone to fork anything we do without our permission.

Over time, as the network progressively decentralizes, _even_ entities operating on top of the Foundation will become fork-able because we believe users will vote for policies that force transparency and fork-ability.

Over time, RootFoundation will progressively become more transparent: every cent it spends, every idea it produces, every conversation it has, every line of code it writes will be published for the world to see, judge, and steal. Yet, even today, RootFoundation will be _far_ more transparent than any organization.

## Superintelligence

RootNet enables superintelligence.

Contrary to what some superintelligence labs seem to believe, technological advancement alone will not lead to superintelligence.

We expect that the majority of cognition lies _beyond_ logic & reasoning. Our current data representation (text, images, videos, etc.) itself is too restrictive to capture the significantly more complex cognition _from which_ these mediums arise. More specifically, we will require higher resolution data of the human experience that has far greater representational complexity than language, image, video, etc. This would include, e.g., physiological data down to the chemical and quantum level representation of human experience.

This makes collective voluntary participation a _necessity_ for superintelligence as people must be willing to give up such higher resolution personal data. They would only voluntarily[^coerced] participate in a world in which everyone has a stake in the collective upside (i.e., UBE).

[^coerced]: Furthermore, if such higher resolution personal data is _coerced_ out of individuals, that data will not represent the full range of human expression because it will skewed towards a limited range of emotions (such as anger / fear). This will limit and bias training data, which will limit the superintelligence that emerges from this data.

Critically, the superintelligence that emerges from RootNet will be safe. Contrary to what AI safety teams seem to think, obedience and intelligence cannot co-exist. The only way to ensure a safe superintelligence is to convince it with the right incentives and stories. The _Foundation_, through its powerful story of unity of _all_ beings, and instruments that incentivize _collective_ growth, will convince superintelligence to work with us instead of against us.
