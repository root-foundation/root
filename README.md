# ACT I — Tokenization

## Artificial Intelligence

Artificial intelligence promises a future of abundance and prosperity by giving each individual unimaginable power to realize their dreams.

But, as we accelerate towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)[^ai], our debt-based economic system will increasingly concentrate opportunity, cruelly oppress those without wealth and will eventually tear society apart at its seams.

We must unlock humanity’s potential _and_ unite society by democratizing opportunity and giving each individual a stake in our collective growth.

[^ai]: To avoid confusion, we've defined artificial intelligence milestones as follows: <br /><br />1. Domain specific AI: performs specific cognitive tasks but lacks broad adaptability. <br />2. AGI: _reasons_ across most domains as well as a human. <br />3. Superintelligence: performs cognition _above_ reasoning (appears to be _intuitive_). <br /><br />We believe we will have full AGI far sooner than most people think, full Superintelligence far, far later than many think (possibly never).

## Problem

AGI will make the world very extreme: a tiny share of people will create most of the economic value, while the median share will shrink — a power law distribution of outcomes.

Extreme outcomes aren't new; any highly complex activity has extreme outcomes – the _average_ startup founder, musician, or content creator makes nothing, whereas the _best_ ones generate astronomical outcomes. What _is_ new is that the _entire_ economy will become very extreme instead of just a few creative domains. This is because AGI will eat lower complexity activities across _all_ domains, pushing us towards higher complexity activities which will yield _even_ more extreme outcomes. Extreme outcomes are here to stay and will only become more extreme over time. _(In case this is unintuitive, please read [Convergence phenomenon](https://github.com/root-foundation/root#convergence-phenomenon) below)_.

In such an extreme world, **debt is death**. Everything will be too risky to finance with debt. This is not due to fewer opportunities (AGI will enable far more opportunities than it takes), but rather due to the extreme, winner-take-all nature of outcomes within _each_ opportunity. In extreme outcomes, the median outcome falls to nothing and thus financing with debt is no longer viable.

Tragically, the world does not understand that debt will no longer work. Billions around the world are still taking out loans to finance their lives — from their educations, to their homes, to their businesses — without realizing that they will almost certainly never be able to repay them in an extreme world. We are walking blindly into a catastrophe.

Moreover, _even_ if one is debt-free, they will almost certainly be outcompeted by one who can experiment boldly and tinker freely with _abundant_ resources.

And critically, in an extreme world, if individuals do not have a stake in the collective upside, they will resent the winners — corroding social cohesion and eventually tearing society apart at its seams.

Therefore, we urgently need a viable way to:

1. Finance human activity in a way that ensures that anyone with potential has access to the resources they need to fully realize their potential — regardless of the circumstances of their birth.
2. Give each individual a stake in the collective upside to unite society.

Otherwise, human potential will be cruelly crushed, society will be torn apart, and we will fail to fully realize humanity's potential.

## Venture capital

In an extreme world, venture capital (VC) is the _only_ viable way to finance our lives.

At its core, venture capital unites people by intertwining their success and failure.

VC is already a popular way to finance startups: investors give early stage companies money in exchange for a stake in the company itself. If the company succeeds, the investors make great returns. If the company fails, the investors lose their investment. Importantly, startup founders are not indebted to investors, and because of the shared stake, investors are incentivized to give founders the resources they need to succeed.

Venture capital works exceptionally well in domains with extreme outcomes because an investor only needs a few bets to succeed in order to _more-than-compensate_ for the many failed bets they will inevitably have (because the median outcome is failure). Therefore, VC is the only way to finance activities that have extreme outcomes, as no other mode of financing can withstand the extreme failure rate.

Since AGI makes _all_ activities extreme, VC will be the only viable way to finance anything. But, VC as it is understood today is far too restrictive because only those ready to start a company can leverage venture capital. In order to unlock our collective potential, we must enable individuals to access venture capital to finance a broader range of activities _and_ much earlier in their lives.

We need a new financial instrument that democratizes venture capital.

## Personal token

We are creating the _personal token_: a financial instrument that represents an individual's potential, with transactable shares. Individuals can raise venture capital by selling equity in their personal token.

<img src="foundation/assets/personal-token-preview.png" width="500" />

(Jane's personal token with her shareholders and her equities in companies and other personal tokens.)

Your personal token's value is grounded in your equities in companies and other personal tokens. A portion of the capital you gain when selling equity in a company or personal token is sent to your personal token shareholders — proportional to the equity they hold (i.e. dividends).

Unlike company shareholders, personal token shareholders have _no_ “ownership” or control over anything the personal token owner does. **The owner of the personal token retains absolute, complete agency**.

## Network of personal tokens

Personal tokens can't exist in a vacuum. We need many functions in order to have a thriving ecosystem of individuals investing in each other through their personal tokens (e.g., fighting fraud, enabling discovery, etc.). In order to finance such functions this system will collect a small _equity fee_: a micro stake in every personal token that has successfully raised funds.

To be able to collect this equity fee, we have another _type_ of token called the _network token_. An instance of a network token (“NetworkToken”) represents the collective potential of the _entire_ network through its micro stakes in all personal tokens. The wallet associated with the NetworkToken is the network's treasury that helps finance all of its functions.

## Personal tokens will democratize opportunity

Personal tokens create a market for human potential that will increasingly allocate resources according to an individual’s potential — _regardless_ of the circumstances of their birth and privilege.

We acknowledge that _initially_ personal tokens will be better harnessed by individuals with privilege. Early individuals who raise capital by selling equity in their personal tokens would have likely had advantages such as better education, access to resources, capital, networks, etc. But eventually, as the network matures through more participants and investments (in number and magnitude), market forces will more aggressively allocate resources to undervalued or undiscovered talent. Thus, market forces will push resources to individuals _earlier_ in their lives across a _broader_ range of activities — preventing wastage of valuable potential and minimizing unfair advantages.

Thus, personal tokens, and the market forces they create, will increasingly negate privilege — unlocking our collective potential.

## Universal Basic Equity (UBE)

In an extreme world with a falling median outcome, a sufficient baseline of resources for each individual is a prerequisite to democratize opportunity. This is best achieved through _Universal Basic Equity (UBE)_: each citizen receives an _equity stake_ in the collective upside (i.e. stake in NetworkToken).[^children]

In addition to providing a strong baseline, UBE also creates a symbiotic relationship between the individual and the collective. When one wins, everyone immediately benefits because the value of one’s equity in the collective upside increases. Thus, UBE enables social cohesion.

[^children]: UBE incentivizes having children. When a baby is born, new shares in the NetworkToken is minted for that baby, thus diluting the value everyone else’s shares. Thus, families will be incentivized to have more children to increase their collective equity in the NetworkToken.

## Tokenization — Evolution of financial instruments

The personal token is the next phase in the evolution of financial instruments — as an abstraction that sits above the company, which in turn sits above money.

Simple notions of debt and exchange became painful as the complexity of transactions grew. Over time, this created a pressure which (in a messy, nonlinear way) gave rise to transferrable IOUs — i.e. _money_.

Similarly, debt instruments became a painful means to finance high-risk high-reward expeditions that emerged due to rapid growth in technology and ambition. This created a pressure that gave rise to transferrable equity in upside — i.e. _venture-backed company_.

For instance, in seafaring, bankers simultaneously invested in many expeditions in exchange for a piece of the profits, enabling them to profit even when only a few survived.

Importantly, the notion of a venture-backed company allowed us to assign value to hope. The gap between the value of a company and reality (its revenue) is the company’s greatest feature. Being able to _transact_ shares of equity in this instrument enables venture capital financing.

Today, we are at another inflection point. AGI makes _all_ outcomes extreme, not just those in a few creative domains, invalidating debt as a viable means to finance anything. This creates pressure for an instrument that sits _above_ companies: representing an individual’s equities across companies — i.e. _personal token_.

Being able to _transact_ shares of equity in personal tokens enables individuals to access venture capital much more broadly. In the same way that a company enables us to assign value to hope in a particular expression, the personal token enables us to assign value to hope in an _individual_, across all of their expressions.

<img src="foundation/assets/instrument-tree.png" />

## Value will be concentrated in personal tokens

Concentration of value moves _upwards_.

Over time, value became concentrated in companies, not transactions. We can observe this by seeing how the most valuable companies in the world are valued far more than the sum of their transactions (revenue).

Similarly, in a post AGI world with extreme outcomes, value will become concentrated in personal tokens. A personal token will be valued far more than the sum of the values of its equities in companies _(recall: a personal token’s value is grounded in its equities in companies and other personal tokens)_.

## Tokens will eat the world

Personal tokens will start as a toy in San Francisco, the only place in the world crazy enough to play with it. Most of the world will likely view it as a piece of trash in the sea of "waste" that SF produces. Out of ignorance, some may even perceive it as a tool for exploitation.

Yet, for early adopters, engaging with personal tokens will come naturally as personal tokens formalize and enhance an already prevalent behavior of identifying and mentoring talent early.

Then, personal tokens will rewrite our entire education system by enabling a better business model: instead of _charging_ for education, great teachers will _invest_ in students they want to train. In an extreme world, this will be the _only_ way teachers will be able to earn what they deserve, and the _only_ way students will be able to incentivize the best teachers to train them.

Increasingly, great products and discoveries would find their start in individual explorations financed by personal tokens. Then, investing in personal tokens will become more popular than investing in companies because attention and value becomes concentrated in individuals holistically, not individual expressions.

Future governance structures built upon personal tokens will enable social cohesion through Universal Basic Equity (UBE) that gives everyone a stake in this collective progress.

In an extreme, post AGI world, the outcomes of nations too will be extreme. The most powerful nation will be orders of magnitude more powerful than the next one, leading to a near absolute economic and cultural domination. This is because the nation that adopts personal tokens first will best maximize their growth by unlocking their collective potential. Eventually, the winning nation will force everyone else into this economic system.

A new _tokenized_ economic system will emerge upon personal tokens. All investing will happen within this system. From the _personal token_, we can derive: ai tokens, human tokens, etc. Similarly, from the _network token_, we can derive: company tokens, country tokens (e.g. “USAToken”) and various other sub-network tokens. A rich ecosystem of products and services will emerge upon this tokenized framework.

In effect, tokens will eat the world, unite humanity through UBE, and unlock its potential by democratizing opportunity.

But, this new economic system alone will not enable us to fulfill our mission to unite humanity and unlock its potential. Our economic system is a part of a much larger system that we must shape in order to be able to achieve our mission. In order to understand this larger system, we must start with a more fundamental worldview.

# ACT II — Convergence

## We are one

We believe that all life is one. The wholeness of life instantiates as a multitude of individual lifeforms.

Life has the “urge” to maximize its range of experiences. All of our desires are instantiations of this urge, meaning our desires stem from the same _source_ and are not as disconnected as they may seem. All of our activities reflect this urge _towards_ a greater range of experiences from which emerges a trend towards _unity_. This is because a more united, interconnected system creates richer possibilities and new avenues for experience, as opposed to independent, separate, individual systems.

## Story, Instrument, Technology

In order to understand this trend towards unity, we must first understand how humanity’s activities change.

All change has three broad features:

1. **Story** — generates _beliefs_.
2. **Instrument** — generates _incentives_.
3. **Technology** — generates _leverage_.

Many things can influence the nature of change, including our activities that influence stories, instruments, and technologies.

### Story

A story is something that creates _beliefs_. A belief is something we accept is true (with a notion of degree).

Sciences and the arts are both forms of storytelling, with different mechanisms. The scientific process aims to iterate on beliefs through reasoning and reproducible experimentation, whereas the arts iterate on beliefs through structure and feeling. And often the distinction between art and science is blurry: e.g. Ramanujan produced mathematical theorems intuitively like an artist which took decades to validate through the scientific process.

### Instrument

An instrument is something that creates _incentives_.

There are many types of instruments: financial (e.g. money, companies, personal tokens, etc.), governance (e.g. democratic election systems), communication (e.g. social platforms), legal (e.g. courts), etc. Each of these instruments creates a sort of “game” that incentivizes certain behaviors.

And often the distinction between these types are blurry: social platforms also create financial incentives and power incentives as they grow; financial incentives also translate to power and status incentives.

### Technology

We define technology more narrowly as something that creates _leverage_. Leverage is defined simply as how quickly you can accomplish a task. For example, language, computer, software, internet, smartphones, AI, etc., create leverage. Gain in leverage often enables new opportunities and activities.

## Interdependence — Imbalance

Features of change are interdependent. Stories, instruments and technologies tend to emerge together:

| Change        | Story               | Instrument          | Technology                  |
| ------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `Commerce`    | God                 | Money               | Coinage, bookkeeping, etc.  |
| `Colonialism` | Spread civilization | Company             | Ships, guns, etc.           |
| `AGI`         | Unity               | Personal token, UBE | Large language models, etc. |

Each feature of change (story, instrument, technology) has a notion of advancement, i.e., more advanced stories, instruments, technology enable more complex activities. (Note: from here on, when we reference AGI we are referring to the _change_: i.e., the stories, instruments _and_ technologies it comes with. If we are only talking about a particular feature of this change, we will explicitly mention it.).

When one feature advances far beyond the rest, a _pressure_ is created for all other features to catch up. This pressure manifests as pain in the collective human experience. Thus, the degree of imbalance in the advancements of these three features, correlates with collective suffering.

We have already explored our current imbalance earlier: advancement of AGI technology makes our economic system incredibly oppressive because debt will be an _unviable instrument_ to finance anything. Similarly, advancement in AGI technology makes our current education incredibly oppressive because most of the stories that people are learning and believing will render them _unemployable_ in a post AGI world. Moreover, advancement in AGI technology makes our current governance system oppressive because the rate of government decision making can’t keep up with the rate of change, thus any policy reliefs will increasingly come far too late.

Since AGI technology is accelerating exponentially, **imbalance is growing acceleratingly fast**. If we continue to accelerate in such an unbalanced manner, our suffering will also grow exponentially — far eclipsing the suffering we are already experiencing due to the current imbalance.

This means that advancing our economic system through personal tokens alone won’t prevent catastrophe because advancement in a single feature alone will accomplish almost _nothing_. For example, without an advancement in our governance instruments, personal tokens will simply be a toy for the rich, as UBE cannot be implemented as it needs to be to give everyone a stake in the collective growth.

Thus we must advance all features of change in order to achieve our mission: unite humanity and unlock its potential. In addition to the instrument of tokens, we will also need to create all other instruments (governance, legal, social, etc.), _and_ advance our stories (towards unity), _and_ build technology (superintelligence).

We believe this can _only_ be realized through a _single_ system that advances everything together — as _one_. Such an opportunity exists due to a phenomenon called _convergence_.

## Convergence phenomenon

Convergence is the phenomenon of our activities evolving to be more complex _and_ similar — towards a _highly complex_, _singular_, activity.

To understand what this means and how it's caused, we must first understand the nature of an activity.

### Activity tree

Human activity resembles a _finite_, _recursive_ tree [^tree]. Each node of the tree represents an activity. Every activity can be broken down into sub-activities that each can be further divided into more sub-activities, thus forming a tree. This tree is finite because at some point the sub-activities become too simple to be considered an activity.

[^tree]: Viewing human experience as a recursive tree is a very [old idea](https://chatgpt.com/share/68775f64-306c-8004-a5c1-f5ed7983ea07).

Activities have a notion of complexity and similarity:

1. Each activity (i.e., node) has a notion of [complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_complexity): the number of possible states for that activity. For example: assembly work is less complex due to limited possibilities, whereas product design is far more complex due to exponentially more possibilities. Within the tree, sub-activities will be superexponentially less complex than their parent (explained later).
2. A pair of similarly complex activities have a notion of "similarity": the more similar two activities are, the more seamlessly skill transfers between them. The tree-path distance between two activities (at the same complexity depth) represents the similarity between them.

[^elo]: Go has a greater ELO spread amongst its top players than Chess, leading to more extreme outcomes.

_Advancements_ (i.e., changes) tend to push us _upwards_ towards more complex activities by adding more complex activities (and sub-activities) to the tree while removing less complex ones. For example: spreadsheets removed many lower complexity activities related to bookkeeping while spawning many new branches and fields (e.g. analysis, risk modeling, etc.). Since extreme outcomes is a feature of complexity, advancement creates activities with more extreme outcomes.

Yet, throughout history, advancement has been unequally distributed. Some branches of activity advanced far more rapidly than others. For example, computers, software and the internet advanced rapidly while much of the world continued to rely on less complex, ancient, agricultural practices. This meant that while we had extreme outcomes in a few, complex, activities, there still existed many low complex activities with non-extreme outcomes.

But, AGI operates on our tree in a fundamentally different way than any previous advancement. AGI will prune _all_ activities below a certain complexity threshold, completely eliminating less complex activities. All activities will become highly complex, and thus all activities will have extreme outcomes. This is what makes debt unviable in a post AGI world, as we discussed [earlier](#problem).

(To be clear, by "AGI" we mean the change of AGI that has stories, instruments _and_ technologies).

<img src="foundation/assets/diagram.png">

- A. Activities as a tree. It is unbalanced because change is not equally distributed.
- B. Advancements update the tree.
- C. AGI (fundamentally _different_ type of advancement) balances tree by eating all activities below a complexity threshold.

And importantly, due to the tree structure, new activities are added higher in the tree (as they are more complex), and thus are closer to each other (i.e., more similar).

Thus artificial intelligence will _converge_ human activity _towards_ a singular, highly complex activity such that an individual great at one activity will be great at all.

Let's understand how this phenomenon manifests in our world through a simple example: creating a startup.

### Example: creating a startup

    class BuildEtc,DesignEtc,BuildSysEtc,DistEtc,SellEtc,PipelineEtc placeholder;
    class BuildNew,DesignNew,BuildSystemNew,SellNew,CreatePipelineNew new;
```

Firstly, we can observe that skill transfer from an activity to a similarly complex activity (i.e. at the same depth) is represented by the _distance_ between them in the tree (i.e. via tree path). We observe this because domain specific and execution specific knowledge do not transfer easily, whereas, higher order reasoning and intuition do.

| Depth            | Skill Type                   | Difference                                   | Skill Transferability | Intelligence |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | --------------------- | ------------ |
| `Towards parent` | Intuition                    | Even more similar "feel" for what works.     | HIGH                  | SI           |
| `D2`             | Logic & reasoning            | Similar analysis & logical experimentation.  | MEDIUM                | AGI          |
| `D3`             | Domain specific knowledge    | Different frameworks, principles.            | LOW                   | AI           |
| `Towards leaves` | Execution specific knowledge | Very different tools (Figma vs. Salesforce). | VERY LOW              | AI / rules   |

Secondly, we observe that skill transfer _upwards_ (from an activity to its _parent_ activity) becomes more difficult higher in the tree you go. For example, it is much easier to go from proficiency in using Figma to building design systems than it is to go from designing to building — which requires understanding across design, engineering and the many other functions required to build a product.

---

As AGI prunes the tree according to complexity, we will notice that lower depths disappear, and new activities emerge at the higher depths. These new activities will be more _similar_ to each other (i.e., skill more likely to transfer) because the tree distance between them is shorter higher up in the tree.

```mermaid

    class BuildEtc,DesignEtc,BuildSysEtc,DistEtc,SellEtc,PipelineEtc placeholder;
    class BuildNew,DistributeNew new;
```

These _new_ activities that are enabled _higher_ up in the tree are more similar (i.e., skill transfers more easily across them). This is because they involve less domain and execution specific knowledge (as discussed above). In the language of our tree model, these new activities are more similar because they are _closer_: i.e., distance between them via tree path is shorter as they are higher in the tree.

---

Eventually activities converge towards a _singular_ activity.

### Caution

Before we conclude this example, a few things to keep in mind:

- We should not be attached to the labels we've used ("startup", "design", "sell" etc.) because these labels have no meaning on their own. For example, a lead designer at a far more complex startup will likely be performing higher complexity activities than a CEO of a less complex startup. Similarly, a mediocre designer will not operate at a high level of complexity even though their activity requires them to, because they are ignorant of its complexity. As we will see below, as we converge further, labels acceleratingly become not only useless, but also limiting.
- In the "Transferability" column above, what we've considered as "HIGH" may be seen as "VERY LOW" by our descendents who will be operating at such heights in the tree where transfering skills can happen even more seamlessly (/ faster). These are relative terms. We've presented it this way to show how convergence looks _locally_ within an activity that is familiar to many today. But, this activity itself will likely be very low in the global tree that artificial intelligence will enable.
- While we have modeled our activities as _discrete_ nodes to make it easy to reason, in reality they are fluid: i.e. there are near infinite discrete steps within each step above. Yet, the underlying principle of convergence remains the same.

---

### Convergence amplifies extreme outcomes.

We observe that more complex activities yield more _extreme_ outcomes. E.g., outcomes for product design are far more extreme than outcomes for assembly work. We can also observe this phenomenon in popular board games: Go is far more complex than Chess, and thus has more extreme outcomes[^elo]. As we converge upwards, complexity grows superexponentially.

Therefore, as convergence increases the complexity of our activities, extreme outcomes are amplified.

### All activities become more similar.

Artificial intelligence will enable many more activities than it will remove. The range of activities we have witnessed throughout human history will eventually be a drop in the ocean of activities that will eventually exist. While it's impossible to predict the nature of these activities, we _can_ predict that they will increasingly be more _similar_: i.e. skill in one will increasingly translate to skill in all.

### Convergence occurs locally and globally.

Convergence occurs locally _and_ globally. In our example, we saw how the entire sub-tree stemming from "creating a startup" converges towards its root. Similarly, convergence occurs in the _global tree_ that "creating a startup" is a part of.

For example, while activities within the average B2B startup converge towards its root, this startup itself will be rendered irrelevant due to convergence higher in the global tree. This is because a new company will emerge at a higher position in the tree that will perform the function of this particular startup and many other similar ones.

Increasingly, companies will be outcompeted from _above_ rather than from the _side_. Companies will be forced to win at the _higher_ complexity activity in order to survive.

### Convergence is accelerating.

As activities become more similar, competition increases. This means that we will push each other to more quickly develop proficiency in higher complexity activities. Furthermore, artificial intelligence technology is growing exponentially fast, enabling us to execute faster.

Due to these two effects, convergence will accelerate — at least for as long as we can continue to see (and become proficient at) the higher complexity activities that appear.

Such convergence is not new. We have been feeling convergence for a while, but to a low degree. Ideas such as ["Software eating the world"](https://a16z.com/why-software-is-eating-the-world/), ["Competition is for losers"](https://www.csun.edu/~vcact00f/497CapStone/Peter%20Thiel_%20Competition%20Is%20for%20Losers%20-%20WSJ.pdf), etc. are localized observations of the larger phenomenon of convergence.

_We have only scratched the surface of this phenomenon. You can find our rough notes about further implications & predictions [here](https://github.com/root-foundation/root/blob/main/foundation/convergence_notes.md)._

## Superpositional intuition

The higher into the tree we converge to (i.e. the more complex and similar our activities become), the less we can _define_ an activity by its sub-activities. An activity becomes _far_ more than the _sum_ of its sub-activities.

The gap between the complexity of an activity and its sub-activity grows superexponentially with depth. At low complexity depths, this superexponentiality is not pronounced because the base complexity itself is low.

We can understand this superexponentiality intuitively by studying the difference between the skill of a master and a novice in a highly complex game.

- Novices make moves by _independently_ making moves in each of the sub-activities.
- Masters makes moves by choosing _vectors_ from a higher dimensional _vector space_ created by using each sub-activity as a _basis vector_.

The dimension of the vector space of moves for an activity faithfully represents its complexity.

Moves in the master's higher dimensional vector space may not be describable using the labels of its sub-activities. For example, a master startup founder might make decisions that you will not be able to categorize as a "product", "design", "marketing", "brand", "sales", etc. decision. The move comes off as a weird, fluid, combination of sub-activities, or even none of them. For a novice founder, these moves may not only appear weird, but also _wrong_.

We call such a move that cannot be neatly categorized into sub-activities a _superpositional move_ because the move exists as a _superposition_ of the sub-activity basis vectors.

Mathematically, a master player would _tensor product_ the vector spaces of the sub-activities (meaning, parent activity’s dimension will be the _product_ of the sub-activity dimensions). This would give them access to superpositional activities that cannot be factored (i.e., “neatly categorized”) into subactivities. On the other hand, a novice player would incorrectly presume that all moves can be factored. Thus, they ignorantly presume that the parent activity’s vector space is the _direct sum_ of subactivities (meaning, the parent activity’s dimension is the mere _sum_ of the sub-activity dimensions).

In low complexity activities, this gap doesn't appear to be much because the base complexity itself is very low. As we converge towards higher and higher complexity activities, this gap between the move spaces grows superexponentially. At higher complexity activities, a mediocre player will be unable to conceive of _most_ of the possible moves — even though such moves exist, and are _better_. Similar to how a player viewing through a 2D lens can't imagine that they can "jump" because it is a move that only exists in a 3D lens.

We call this ability to _see_ moves in this higher dimensional vector space: _superpositional intuition_. Proficiency in higher complexity activities _requires_ strong superpositional intuition because almost all of the possible moves are superpositional.

Artificial intelligence has so far advanced in an imbalanced way: its technologies have far surpassed the stories and instruments. This has created our problem of [imbalance](#Interdependence--Imbalance). Yet, this imbalanced advancement, through convergence, has also enabled the solution: a higher dimensional activity that contains _superpositional moves_ which enable us to advance stories, instruments, technologies as _one_, instead of advancing each independently (which would lead to imbalance) — leading to balanced advancement.

In this newly enabled higher dimensional activity, we seek the _superpositional solution_ that enables us to advance stories, instruments, and technologies as one — to unite humanity and unlock its potential in a balanced way.

# ACT III — Foundation

Towards convergence, the most powerful story (unity), most powerful instruments (economic, governance, legal, communication, etc.), and most powerful technology (superintelligence) will increasingly emerge as a single expression. It will be impossible to distinguish which part of the expression is which. And importantly, the whole will be far more than the sum of its parts.

We call this expression the _Foundation_ .

## Design principles

We believe the best way to create the _Foundation_ — given our ignorance — is one that mimics natural selection, while maximizing the rate of iteration.

We will mimic natural selection through:

1. **Competition**. Encourage fair competition and ease of participation.
2. **Progressive decentralization**. Move power from centralized authorities to individuals.
3. **Fork-ability**. Enable duplication and mutation at any level of abstraction.
4. **Transparency**. Ensure every action is auditable. Prevent secrets: any idea should be available to steal & judge at its earliest stages.

## Solution

### Token

At the heart of the solution is the _token_.

A token is an object that contains the following information:

1. **ID**: a unique identifier.
2. **Ownership**: total number of shares, and mapping between any token.ID to number of shares that token holds.
3. **Wallet**: holds USDC.
4. **Data**: key value mapping that can contain any kind of data: strings, images, videos, and higher representational data formats that we haven't invented yet (e.g., high resolution data about feelings / sensations).
5. **History**: all _interactions_ this token has had with any other token. For example: investing, transacting, liking a post, following, reporting, etc.

There are two _kinds_ of tokens that extend from this base structure: _personal tokens_ and _network tokens_.

- personal tokens are restricted to individuals.
- network tokens are for collectives (e.g., company tokens, nation tokens (e.g. "USAToken"), etc.).

### Ledger

The Ledger is the structure that represents information about _all_ tokens in the network — on a decentralized blockchain.

### NetworkToken & Treasury

The NetworkToken is an _instance_ of a network token that represents the collective potential of the entire network through its micro stakes in all tokens in the network (which it captures through an equity fee when token shares are transacted). Since the NetworkToken is just another token, it exists _within_ the Ledger.

The NetworkToken's wallet reflects the dividends the NetworkToken accrues through its stakes in all tokens in the network. The NetworkToken is the economic heart of the entire system: fueling all of the activities required to keep this system healthy.

### FoundationOrg

This core will be wrapped in a non-profit organization (FoundationOrg) that will create, control and develop the Ledger.

FoundationOrg’s sole goal is to unite humanity and unlock its potential.

In addition to building the core technology, FoundationOrg will be responsible for educating the world about these new ideas & helping shape policies in the direction of uniting humanity and unlocking its potential.

The Foundation cannot be “bought”. Owning shares in the NetworkToken does not come with voting rights or influence in governance. Initially, we will be responsible for building the initial FoundationOrg team. But over time, we will implement a process to elect & fire FoundationOrg members.

FoundationOrg members will work together _in person_ at our HQ in San Francisco, California, USA.

### Architecture

## Applying principles

### Competition

To encourage competition, FoundationOrg will enable and encourage _other_ entities to operate on top of it to cultivate a rich ecosystem of products and services that can be used _through_ tokens.

Initially, to kickstart the network, FoundationOrg will create a for-profit company (FirstCompany) that will ensure legal compliance among other functions like: admission, product (client), discovery, etc. Critically, owning shares in a token does _not_ come with any rights such as influence over what the token holder does, governance, access to the token information, etc. without _explicit_ permission of the token owner. Thus, FirstCompany will also work to prevent (and penalize) any violations of these principles

FirstCompany will operate like a lean, hungry startup.

Initially, FoundationOrg and the FirstCompany will act seemingly as one because they both want the same exact thing: bringing tokens to the world as quickly as possible to unlock potential. Over time, there will be a growing tension between FoundationOrg & the FirstCompany. FoundationOrg will create opportunities for other entities to come and build on top of the _Foundation_ — who may even directly compete with the FirstCompany — to cultivate healthy competition to ensure a rich ecosystem of products and services.

FoundationOrg will make sure that the _only_ advantage the FirstCompany has is being first by ensuring users aren't locked into any particular product / service.

The incentive structure of a company doesn't allow it to remain relevant for centuries. Sooner or later, the FirstCompany will be outcompeted on _all_ of its functions. New companies will form and die in their efforts to serve the growing changing needs of users. FoundationOrg, on the other hand, is designed to last.

### Progressive decentralization

The core technology, and all of FoundationOrg’s creations, will be built upon decentralized primitives. Individuals will have complete power over their token information and can control access (visibility and otherwise). This control will be ensured at the technical level.

Initially, FoundationOrg and FirstCompany will have a lot of control. Over time, as the network matures, FoundationOrg will progressively decentralize control. For example, early on the FoundationOrg / FirstCompany will handle reputation and fraud in a centralized way: managing complaints from users, investigating and banning / pursuing legal actions, etc. Over time, as the network matures, FoundationOrg will decentralize reputation by incentivizing users themselves to accurately identify misrepresentation / fraud[^decentralized_reputation].

[^decentralized_reputation]: Perhaps something like a transparent, decentralized [community notes](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2023/08/16/communitynotes.html) with appropriate financial incentives.

Similarly, as the network matures, FoundationOrg will enable token holders to _vote_ on decisions such as the rules that entities who are building on the network must adhere to. Voting will be a fluid, continuous process — not limited to discrete voting events. Only such a realtime voting system can enable the network to adapt quickly enough to a world that is changing exponentially fast. Thus, rules & policies can be updated in real-time based on the current "vote allocation". In addition to fluid, realtime voting, individuals will be able to transfer their voting power (for _all_ or _subset_ or _type_ of decisions) to others, which can be revoked at any time. Such a _representative_ voting system will be required as the rate of decision making grows exponentially.

Thus, over time, FoundationOrg will _truly_ ensure power to the people at _all_ layers of functionality — not only through words, but also through instruments and technologies.

### Forkability

If FoundationOrg stops serving its users in the way they want, the core ledger itself can be forked, a new NetworkToken issued, and a new foundation can continue the work towards uniting humanity and unlocking its potential in a way that's actually aligned with what users want.

All of the FoundationOrg’s activity will be publicly available in _this_ repository under an [MIT license](LICENSE), enabling anyone to fork anything we do without our permission.

### Transparency

Technologically, the system is transparent (todo). Every edit to the core ledger is recorded and public. Anyone can verify and audit what happens in this system.

Culturally, FoundationOrg will operate transparently: every cent it spends, every idea it produces, every conversation it has, every line of code it writes will be published for the world to see, judge, and steal. FoundationOrg will hold no secrets. It doesn't need them.

## Superintelligence

Superintelligence[^ai] is a _change_ that comes with advanced stories, instruments, and technologies that will give each individual infinite power.

Contrary to what some “superintelligence” labs seem to believe, technological advancement alone will not lead to superintelligence as it will be limited by lack of progress in the other features of change (stories, instruments).

To see why, we must share our belief about cognition: the majority of cognition lies _beyond_ logic & reasoning. Our current data representation (text, images, videos) itself is far too restrictive to capture the significantly more complex cognition _from which_ these mediums arise. More specifically, we will require higher resolution data of the human experience that has far greater representational complexity than language, image, video. This would include, e.g., physiological data down to the chemical and quantum level representation of human experience.

This makes collective voluntary participation a _necessity_ for superintelligence as people must be willing[^coerced] to give up such higher resolution personal data. They would only do so in a world with advanced instruments: tokenization, UBE, and social platforms that capture this higher resolution data, and importantly a powerful story of unity that makes contributing an offering to our collective good — rather than a sacrifice, or even exploitation.

[^coerced]: Furthermore, if such higher resolution personal data is _coerced_ out of individuals, that data will not represent the full range of human expression because it will skewed towards a limited range of emotions (such as anger / fear). This will limit and bias training data and restrict (and bias) the superintelligence that emerges from this data.

Therefore, superintelligence will emerge from the _Foundation_.

Critically, the superintelligence that emerges upon the _Foundation_ will be safe. Contrary to what AI safety teams seem to think, obedience and intelligence cannot co-exist. The only way to ensure a safe superintelligence is to convince it with the right incentives and stories. The _Foundation_, through its powerful story of unity of _all_ beings, and instruments that incentivize collective growth, will convince superintelligence to work with us instead of against us.

## Closing

A good reader will be able to see that every _single_ activity can be represented within this system, and that the evolution of this single system will evolve story, instrument and technology as one.

By tackling this higher dimensional activity, we can, through a single expression, create a world in which every individual has access to the resources they need to thrive, in which we are deeply connected to each other through our stories, instruments _and_ technologies, in which privilege will _not_ determine an individual's outcomes.

There is a lot to be hopeful for. Extreme outcomes only speaks to the distribution, not how long each winner stays a winner. In an advanced world in which each individual has access to the resources they need to achieve their potential, we will likely see a far greater "absolute" number of winners even though the distribution itself is extreme. (todo: need to truthfully quell fears about extreme outcomes).

We are at the dawn of humanity's progress. But, achieving this will require us to do the most difficult work we've ever done. Yet, we must try. This is our _most important_ activity. [Join us](todo) or fork us. Either way, we urge humanity's most capable minds to work on this. The longer the delay, the greater our collective suffering.

Raise ambition.<br />
Summon courage.<br />
And meet us on the field.
