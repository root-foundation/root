#### RootNet: prosperity through unity

If we continue on our current path, AI will concentrate opportunity, leave billions behind, and cause unimaginable suffering.

RootNet is how humanity will win in the age of AI.

#### I) Problem

In a post AGI world, debt will no longer work.

Though we will have more winners, AGI will make outcomes in all activities extreme ("winner-takes-most" power law distribution). The median outcome will trend toward failure like in startups / content creation, meaning most people who take on loans will not able to repay them. 

When debt fails, opportunity will concentrate in the hands of those already wealthy enough to tinker and take bold risks without fear of ruin, dividing society and driving decay.

Slowing down AI is *not* the solution. AI enables progress. Instead, we must organize ourselves in a way that democratizes opportunity and unites humanity so that we *rise together*.

####  II) RootNet

RootNet democratizes opportunity by creating a market for *potential* to create value.

This enables people to raise venture capital (VC), rather than debt, to finance education, housing, and more broadly life, well before they are ready to create value.

Unlike debt, VC aligns people by intertwining both upside and downside. By valuing future potential over current ability, it channels resources toward those with promise, ultimately favoring talent over privilege.

RootNet also raises our baseline by structurally tying individual success and collective prosperity: each of us holds a stake in the collective that holds a stake in each of us. 

On RootNet, when one wins, all win. Only through such incentive-driven structural unity can humanity thrive in the age of AI.

#### III) Token

RootNet is based on a single primitive — *the token* — an instrument that represents potential to create value, with transactable shares. 

There are three types of tokens: network, personal, and idea.

- Network token represents collective potential.
- Personal token represents individual potential.
- Idea token represents idea potential (e.g., a company).

The value of tokens is grounded in reality: network tokens hold personal tokens, which hold idea tokens (companies), which are tied to revenue. Tokens aren’t memes, but rather instruments built on top of companies, which in turn sit on top of money (i.e., real revenue).

#### IV) NetworkToken

At the heart of RootNet is the NetworkToken (an instance of a network token), which holds stakes in all users (i.e., in their personal tokens).

The NetworkToken represents humanity’s collective potential.

The NetworkToken enables us to increase our baseline through Universal Basic *Equity* (UBE): each person can be periodically issued shares in the NetworkToken.

UBE will close the gap between individual and collective success. Instead of waiting to tax capital gains, any breakthrough, discovery, or creation that strengthens belief that we will create more value in the future will immediately raise the value of the NetworkToken (and thus the wealth in everyone's hands).

Unlike [Universal Basic *Income*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_basic_income), UBE won't lead to inflation because people are incentivized to hold rather than spend (proportional to our hope in the future).

#### V) True value

RootNet enables us to represent what we truly value, including contributions we can't capture in today's economy.

Because we each hold a stake in our collective potential (NetworkToken), any action that harms our shared future, even if profitable in the short term, will be strongly disincentivized because it will tank the NetworkToken's value (and thus reduce the wealth in each of our hands).

This aligns self-interest with global cooperation. We will solve collective problems like climate change only when everyone has a strong incentive to act together.

RootNet also represents value that we cannot tangibly represent today. For example, great parents and even artists that raise our collective hope will be valued on RootNet and will be able to raise capital. 

#### VI) Foundation for Civilization

RootNet will change our world. It will democratize opportunity, structurally unite humanity so we rise *together*, grow wealth without inflation, [rewrite education](RootNet/appendix/Education.md) through better incentives, and represent what we truly value. RootNet is a new foundation for civilization that achieves prosperity through unity.

RootNet will progressively decentralize power so that the people will eventually control everything.

Join us to build the future of humanity.

Or steal this idea and compete.

May the best network win and lift us all with it.
