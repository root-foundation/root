# RootNet: Prosperity through Unity.

## I) Problem

If we continue on our current path, AI will concentrate opportunity, leave billions behind, and cause unimaginable suffering.

RootNet is how humanity will win in the age of AI.

AI will make our world *dynamic* and *extreme*.

The biggest wins will grow far larger, but winners will fall faster. Opportunities will skyrocket, competition will intensify, and more people will touch success. Yet at any moment, outcomes will be concentrated in fewer hands across every field: **an extreme power law distribution of outcomes.**

But due to extreme outcomes, **debt no longer works**.

And yet, our world still runs on debt.<br/>
What happens when only a few can repay loans?<br/>
Will the government help?<br/>
What will happen to those in poorer nations?<br/>
Unimaginable suffering.

This collapse is only one of many.<br/>
In education, most are learning skills that will make them utterly unemployable.<br/>
In governance, laws and regulations can’t keep up with AI.<br/>
In media, AI creates content faster than we can verify truth.<br/>
And many others.

When one system races ahead (AI) while others lag, imbalance grows.<br/>
Accelerating AI means accelerating imbalance, which means accelerating suffering. 

Slowing down AI is *not* the solution. AI enables progress.<br/>
Instead, we must *reorganize* ourselves to advance *without imbalance* so that we take advantage of AI to *prosper together*.

Otherwise, opportunity will be concentrated in a few hands, dividing us and accelerating collapse.

## II) RootNet

We need RootNet.

**RootNet democratizes opportunity** by creating a market for *potential*.

This enables people to raise venture capital (VC), *rather than debt*, to finance education, housing, and more broadly life, *well before they are ready to create value*.

Unlike debt, VC aligns people by sharing both upside and downside. By valuing _future_ potential over current ability, it channels resources toward those with promise, eventually favoring talent over privilege.

**RootNet also raises our baseline** by structurally tying individual success and collective prosperity: each of us holds a *stake* in the collective that holds a *stake* in each of us. 

On RootNet, when one wins, all win.

Only through such *structural* unity based on incentives can humanity thrive in the age of AI.

## III) The Token

RootNet is based on a single primitive — *the token* — an instrument that represents potential to create value, with transactable shares. 

There are three types of tokens: network, personal, and idea.<br/>  
Network token represents collective potential.<br/>
Personal token represents individual potential.<br/>
Idea token represents idea potential (e.g., a company).

The value of tokens is grounded in reality: network tokens hold personal tokens, which hold idea tokens (companies), which are tied to revenue. Tokens aren’t memes, they are instruments that sit *on top of* companies (which sit on top of money, i.e., revenue).

## IV) The NetworkToken

At the heart of RootNet is the **NetworkToken**, a network token that holds stakes in all users (via their personal tokens), while each user holds a stake in it. 

The NetworkToken represents _humanity’s collective potential_.

Because we each hold a *stake* in our collective potential, an action that harms our shared future, even if profitable in the short term, will be strongly disincentivized because it will tank the NetworkToken's value (and reduce the wealth in *all* of our hands).

RootNet will change our world. It will grow collective wealth _without inflation_ through Universal Basic _Equity_, rewrite education with better incentives, and align incentives with what we _truly_ value. RootNet will even _enable_ superintelligence.

## V) New Foundation for Civilization

RootNet is a new foundation for civilization that achieves prosperity through unity.

RootNet will be progressively decentralized so that the people will eventually control everything.

Fork-able.<br/>
Open source.<br/>
Transparent.<br/>
Nonprofit.<br/>

Join us to build the future of humanity.<br/>
Or steal this idea and compete.<br/>
May the best network win and lift us all with it.
