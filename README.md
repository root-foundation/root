### About

AGI will make all outcomes extreme (power law distribution). The median outcome will trend toward failure (like in startups / content creation), meaning most people who take on loans will not able to repay them. **Debt will no longer work**.  

When debt fails, _opportunity concentrates in the hands of those already wealthy_ enough to tinker and take bold risks without fear of ruin.

We're solving this with RootNet. 

RootNet creates a market for potential, through a new primitive — *the token* — that represents potential of a collective, individual, or idea, with transactable shares. RootNet enables us to finance our lives through *venture capital* instead of debt.
