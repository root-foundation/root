Personal tokens will rewrite our entire education system by enabling a better business model: instead of _charging_ for education, great teachers will _invest_ in students they want to train. In an extreme world, this will be the _only_ way teachers will be able to earn what they deserve, and the _only_ way students will be able to incentivize the best teachers to train them.

An education system based on _investing_ instead of charging money will improve the quality of knowledge available for everyone â€” _even_ for students who aren't yet ready to be invested in. Teachers who charge money to teach are incentivized to hoard their most important knowledge to only paying students. Teacher-investors, on the other hand, are _incentivized_ to spread _all_ of their knowledge as widely as they can in order to attract more investable talent.

Increasingly, great products and discoveries will find their start in individual explorations financed by personal tokens. Then, investing in personal tokens will become more popular than investing in companies because attention and value become concentrated in individuals holistically, not in their particular expressions.
