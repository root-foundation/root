# ACT I — AGI

## Introduction

Artificial intelligence promises a future of abundance and prosperity in which each individual gains unimaginable power to realize their dreams.

Yet, we are far from *organizing* humanity in a way that enables us to take advantage of artificial intelligence towards prosperity instead of destruction. In this essay we share our beliefs about how AGI will change our world, and how we must organize ourselves to take advantage of this change.

## How AGI changes our world

By Artificial *General* Intelligence (AGI) we mean an intelligence that can generally *reason* across any task as well as any human. And that this intelligence also sufficiently *embodied* such that it is capable of doing most physical tasks that humans do today (e.g. agriculture, assembly, delivery, etc.). We believe we will achieve full AGI sooner than expected, and that such AGI will amplify human potential, *not* replace the need for humans.

Predictions:

As artificial intelligence advances, our activities will *acceleratingly* evolve to become more ***complex*** (i.e., more possibilities within them) and more ***alike*** (i.e., being great at one will increasingly translate to being great at all).

**Outcomes in *all* activities will become increasingly *extreme***: at any given moment in time, a *smaller* percentage of individuals will be responsible for a *greater* share of economic value created — i.e., a *[power law distribution of outcomes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_law)*. The peak outcomes grow exponentially, while the median share falls.

**Rate of displacement of the winners accelerates exponentially.** Those who are generating the greatest outcomes will increasingly struggle to retain their dominance. Churn will accelerate.

**The absolute number of winners will increase greatly**. Even though the distribution of outcomes will be far more extreme, since the peak outcomes grow exponentially, even *tiny* wins (relative to the peak wins) will still be massive. And since the rate of displacement accelerates, in a given period of time, there will be many more who would have touched success. We're already seeing early signs of this (todo).

**Artificial intelligence will enable many more activities than it will render unnecessary**. The range of activities we have witnessed throughout human history will eventually be a drop in the ocean of activities that will eventually exist. While it's impossible to predict the nature of these activities, we _can_ predict that they will be increasingly _similar_: i.e. ability in one will increasingly translates to ability in all, and that they will be highly complex with increasingly extreme outcomes.

(todo: talk about how increasingly our imaginations and ability to see possibilities will be our biggest bottlenecks).

**Notions of separate domains and roles will disappear**. As our activities become more complex and alike, rigidly defined domains and roles won't exist. We are seeing early signs of this: roles within startups are converging towards a singular "founder" role, and startups themselves are becoming much more than just "technology" companies.

**Being outcompeted from *above* will be the norm.** Companies operating at higher levels of complexity will more quickly render more number of companies operating at lower levels of complexity unnecessary. For example: a more general robotics company will render many, many domains specific robotics companies (e.g. agriculture robotics company) obsolete. Previously, due to slow pace of change, domain specific companies had time to survive and thrive. As AGI rapidly advances, more niche companies will be rendered obsolete more quickly by a more general company (i.e., operating at a higher level of complexity) offering a competing service.

It will become exponentially more difficult to grow *upwards*: i.e start small and grow ambitious, forcing the most ambitious to *start* from above.

(todo: express notion that each "eat" from above will become bigger and bigger - due to being higher in the tree).

**Such change will accelerate.**
- Even if we see sporadic "winters" in certain activities, there will be so much growth overall such that we won't *feel* a winter. Even today, if we somehow made no more developments on LLMs for 

AGI will enable us to solve many problems we consider complex and will push us upwards towards tackling higher and higher complexity problems. AGI will enable us to solve many problems we feel are too complex to solve, promising a future of abundance and prosperity... *if* we can organize ourselves to take advantage of it. (todo: but, as you can see... the shape of our world will be fundamentally altered).

(todo: combine all above to paint the picture of a fluid world with great change and churn with us doing more and more complex activities using artificial intelligence as a helpful tool to tackle such high complexity activities that we can't dream of. to give sense of this diff, compare current highly complex activities with what our ancestors did).

(todo: try to converge some of the predictions into higher level predictions. simplify).

(todo: also paint the accurate picture of the difficulties of higher complexity activities and how going *upwards* will become exponentially more difficult.)

These predictions are derived from a phenomenon we call [Convergence](Convergence.md)[^convergence]. *(read about convergence before proceeding in case you are interested in the explanations for these predictions).* 

[^convergence]: We believe Convergence is a fundamental phenomenon that not only explains how AGI will change our world, but also many other seemingly unrelated concepts (such as evolution, etc.).

## Problem

Artificial intelligence promises a future in which each of us has unimaginable power to realize our dreams, in which we can best tackle our most complex challenges. But, we must organize ourselves in a fundamentally different way to be able to take advantage of it.

- imbalance
- suffering
- examples of the many imbalances
- why they must be tackled together, as one, not separately.
