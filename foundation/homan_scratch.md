_unfiltered, unedited notes. most will be useless. assume nothing written here will reflect what i will eventually believe and do. this is an even rougher stream of consciousness than what i post on social media. _

i want people who fork this idea (or any part of it) to be able to even remove our names and claim it as theirs. maybe the MIT license isn't permissive enough? need to look into this at some point.

if this gets even one status hungry person to try and work on this, that's a win â€” maybe they have something to add that we're missing.

at convergence, the only activity will be seeking truth, and the most important skill will be _intuition_ for what is true (since SI will take the intuition and run infinite experiments to find all possible downstream consequences of that intuition).

e.g. einstein in a post AGI world would have been able to say roughly "i want you to explore my intuition about light... i think this and that concept are somewhat related among others... go at it." and ai should spit out relativity among hundreds of other implications in a bunch of domains we didn't think were connected to this. AI will be able to construct the physical apparatus to run the experiments as well. basically all nonsense work (including reasoning & experimentation) will be eliminated.

ai responds to einstein with a nuanced overview of what it discovered... and maybe even tell him that from what it found so far, his intuition is off. this would enable this future einstein to iterate on their intuitions and keep sending ai on ambitious expeditions to figure out more and more things.

i really need someone to process my 20k word draft on seeking truth. i can't work on that now bec. there are higher priority things to focus on rn. i predict this will be a 1 - 2 year project to get an incredible draft (ofc while publishing continuously throughout). seeking truth is very nuanced skill, but this is the most important skill as we approach convergence.

it literally hurts me that this idea is just sitting unattended right now. fuck... someone please reach out and take this up. ill fund this by investing in your personal token (if i think youre capable of writing this, and ofc only if you want me to invest).

In the essay to attract future teammates need the following:

I will only work with you if you promise the following: if you believe you can outcompete me at leading this organization by doing the higher complexity work that I'm doing better than I can, you _must_ raise this belief to everyone in the team and share a compelling argument for why you should replace me. If I disagree with your assessment that you are better than me, and after reflection if you still disagree with my judgement, you must promise to quit and fork this project and try to outcompete this organization. If you fork us, I will almost certainly invest in you (bec if you're good enough to be accepted into this team in the first place, it means that I think you're generational talent). You must have this sort of courage to follow your truth. Your allegiance is to humanity, not this organization. Humanity _needs_ this expression to succeed, and the more competing forks we have, the better off everyone is.

This is super important. There are too many people who have better intuitions than those leading their companies but lack the courage to leave and compete. We've collectively lost so much due to such individual cowardice.
