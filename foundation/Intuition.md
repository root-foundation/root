The higher up in the tree we [converge](Convergence.md) (i.e. the more complex and similar our activities become), the less we can define an activity by its sub-activities. An activity becomes far more than the sum of its sub-activities.

The gap between the complexity of an activity and its sub-activity grows superexponentially as we go up the tree (i.e. towards root). At low complexity depths, this superexponentiality is not pronounced because the base complexity itself is low.

We can understand this superexponentiality intuitively by studying the difference between the ability of a master and a novice in a highly complex game.

- Novices make moves by independently making moves in each of the sub-activities.
- Masters makes moves by choosing vectors from a higher dimensional vector space[^math] created by using each sub-activity as a basis vector.

The dimension of the vector space of moves for an activity faithfully represents its complexity.

Moves in the master's higher dimensional vector space may not be describable using the labels of its sub-activities. For example, a master startup founder might make decisions that you will not be able to categorize as a "product", "design", "marketing", "brand", "sales", etc. decision. Their moves may come off as a weird, fluid, combination of sub-activities, or even none of them. For a novice founder, these moves may not only appear weird, but also wrong. As complexity grows, increasingly, a mediocre player will be unable to conceive of most of the possible moves — even though such moves exist, and are better. Similar to how a player viewing through a 2D lens can't imagine that they can "jump" because it is a move that only exists in a 3D lens.

[^math]: Mathematically, a master player would tensor product the vector spaces of the sub-activities (meaning, parent activity’s dimension will be the product of the sub-activity dimensions). This would give them access to superpositional activities that cannot be factored (i.e., “neatly categorized”) into subactivities. On the other hand, a novice player would incorrectly presume that all moves can be factored. Thus, they ignorantly presume that the parent activity’s vector space is the direct sum of subactivities (meaning, the parent activity’s dimension is the mere sum of the sub-activity dimensions).

We call such a move that cannot be neatly categorized into sub-activities a superpositional move because the move exists as a superposition of the sub-activity basis vectors5.

We call this ability to see moves in this higher dimensional vector space superpositional intuition. Proficiency in higher complexity activities requires strong superpositional intuition because almost all of the possible moves are superpositional.
