## Growth rates

Growth comes in layers, each one a step-change in _how quickly quick really is_:
1. **Linear** adds a fixed chunk every period—steady cruise-control at 60 mph.
2. **Super-Linear** (often a power law like _t²_) still accelerates, but only because each _addition_ is a bit larger than the last; the gaps between milestones _widen_.
3. **Exponential** multiplies by a constant factor; the celebrated “every X days it doubles,” so milestone spacing stays the same.
4. **Super-Exponential** multiplies by a factor that itself explodes; doubling time _shrinks_—what looked distant suddenly crashes into the present.

|Growth type|Canonical form _f(t)_|Rate _f′(t)_|Doubling-time trend|Everyday analogy|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Linear**|_k t + c_|Constant slope _k_|Wait **twice as long** to double|Add $10 each day|
|**Super-Linear**|_tᵖ_, p > 1|Climbs as a power of _t_|Each doubling takes **longer** than the last|Snowball turning into a boulder|
|**Exponential**|_a bᵗ_, b > 1|∝ current size|**Constant** (e.g., every 7 days)|7 % compound interest|
|**Super-Exponential**|e.g. _b^{cᵗ}_, _t!_|Rate outraces size|**Shrinks** (7 → 3.5 → 1.7 days)|3-D printers making more printers|
