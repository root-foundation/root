RootNet is a network that enables collective prosperity in the age of AI — through unity.

### Email

**Subject**: RootNet — collective prosperity in the age of AI

**Body**:

The way we’re headed, AI will concentrate opportunity and divide us. RootNet is our attempt to solve this.

RootNet is a network where anyone can invest in the potential of collectives, people, or ideas (e.g., companies) by trading shares of their tokens which are grounded in reality (revenue). 

At its heart is the _NetworkToken_, which holds stakes in all users, and each user holds a stake in it — *structurally* uniting us so that when one wins, we all win.

Only through such unity can AI lead to collective prosperity.

### Core emotion

RootNet represents:
- Warmth. Individuals becoming one by intertwining their success and failure.
- Unity. We can only succeed together. Divided we fall.
- Care. We collectively work towards a better future for our descendants, who will enjoy a level of abundance and prosperity we can’t fathom.

Every child that joins RootNet must feel the warmth and care of the many generations who toiled to give them a world of freedom, prosperity, abundance. And through that warmth, they must also feel the responsibility to continue the tradition of building an even better future for their descendants. A *culture* and *tradition* that must define humanity.

RootNet is a story about unity, collective prosperity, togetherness, warmth, care, wellbeing.
