# @homan

I’m [homan](https://x.com/homanspirit) (legal name: Karthik Uppuluri). I'm building [RootNet](https://onroot.net/).

This page represents my personal token (@homan). After RootNet launches, my token's information will be represented on chain.

A personal token is an instrument that represents its owner’s potential. Its value is grounded in the owner’s equities in companies and other tokens (personal or network). Holders can transact shares and share in upside, but unlike company shareholders, they have **no control, voting rights, or say** over the life of the token owner. (Read the [whitepaper](https://onroot.net/whitepaper).)

#### current holders

## Philosophy

Investing in @homan is not investing in one company or idea, but across **all** of my ideas, creations, and investments. You are expressing belief in me holistically.

By investing, you unite your fate with mine: my success is your success, my failure your failure. This is deeper than investing in any one company, because it spans my entire journey.

My personal token shareholders are those in my corner as I play the game of life itself. This relationship is special. Over time, my personal token cap table will represent those who believed in me.

## The Shareholder Relationship

Owning @homan is not a passive investment. It is an **active and intentional relationship**.

I want my shareholders to be people who actively contribute to my success, whether by opening doors, amplifying my work, offering guidance, or strengthening RootNet itself. My cap table is not just a list of investors; it is a reflection of who is in my corner.

Because a personal token is more **personal and long-term** than a typical investment instrument, this level of curation is required. Shareholding in @homan isn't about quick liquidity or short-term speculation; it's about building enduring alignment over a long term.

Accordingly, shareholding in @homan is **curated**:
- **Entry:** I will only accept *new* shareholders if I believe their involvement will significantly and positively impact my success.
- **Exit:** If a shareholder no longer contributes to my success (or actively _harms_ it) **I retain the option to repurchase their shares at its valuation at the time of this buyback**.

My goal is for @homan’s cap table to reflect those *actively* in my corner. Over time, I may introduce a distinction between **active** shareholders (who significantly and positively contribute to my success and may retain rights such as pro rata participation) and **passive** shareholders, who can continue to hold and benefit from their shares but may lose certain rights (e.g., pro rata or ownership caps). This ensures ownership reflects real impact, without requiring ejection of every non-active holder.

This principle is built directly into the mechanics below.

## Overview

I am raising the first rounds on my personal token **@homan** ahead of RootNet’s launch. These are structured as **token warrants**. Early investors receive a discount and valuation cap, rather than a fixed price, to account for the fact that the market does not yet know how to value personal tokens.

- **Pre-seed I:** $100K raise, **50% discount, $10M cap**.
- **Pre-seed II:** $400K raise, **25% discount, $50M cap**. (total raised = $500k).
- **Seed (first priced round):** Shares in @homan token issued on RootNet post-launch, as the first round on RootNet.

**Use of proceeds:** to accelerate launching RootNet.

**Investor return:** Warrants convert into @homan shares at the better of the discount or cap. Thereafter, **I will distribute my realized capital gains** (from equities in companies and tokens on RootNet: personal tokens, network tokens, etc.) back to @homan holders as dividends, proportional to their ownership.

**Liquidity:** Shares are transferable only after RootNet launches and after a one-year lock. (See [Mechanics → Liquidity](#liquidity).)

**As a holder, you share in my upside but have no control over my life or decisions.** Owning @homan is both a direct bet on my potential and a leveraged bet on **RootNet**. As I build RootNet and direct my resources into it, early @homan holders share in that compounded upside.

## Mechanics

#### No rights

Holders have no control, voting rights, or say in my life or decisions.

#### Liquidity

Secondary sales will be possible after RootNet launches, after a **one-year lock**. Approval of a new shareholder is not automatic: I will only approve buyers who I believe will significantly and positively impact my success. This is a deliberately high bar, consistent with the curated shareholder relationship described above.

All approvals and rejections are recorded publicly on-chain, ensuring transparency and accountability, while strongly disincentivizing misuse.

Please only invest if you are aligned with my long-term journey. This is not a short-term trading instrument.

#### Dilution

New rounds issue new shares. Pro rata rights allow you to maintain your %.

#### Dividends

Whenever I sell equity in companies or tokens (other personal tokens / network tokens on RootNet), **I will distribute realized capital gains in direct proportion to each holder’s ownership at the moment of sale.** For example, if I sell $1M and you hold 1% of @homan, you receive $10k before taxes.

I plan to *only* invest on RootNet. This means all of my holdings and sales will be on chain and dividends will be issued programmatically (immediately) to you on-chain.

#### Fees

Each issuance incurs a small equity fee to RootNetToken (shares in my personal token). Each secondary sale also incurs a small equity fee to RootNetToken and a royalty to me. Fees are expected to be very small (low single-digit basis points), with exact numbers finalized pre-launch.

#### Ejection

Shareholding is an active relationship. If a shareholder no longer contributes to my success, or worse, actively harms it, I retain the option to repurchase their shares **at its valuation at the time of this buyback**. 

Any ejection would be recorded publicly on-chain, together with supporting evidence, to ensure transparency, fairness, and to strongly disincentivize misuse.

## Closing

This page is the source of truth for my personal token, and this agreement, until we officially launch this token on RootNet.

Every edit is traceable.

## Questions

#### Do I have exposure to your income?
NO. Personal token shareholders have no claim on any income, salary, or personal assets. Upside is only via equities (companies / tokens) I hold.

#### Do I need to join RootNet?
YES. The first priced round will occur on RootNet. To convert your investment, you must join and create your own personal token (which will hold @homan shares on the ledger).
